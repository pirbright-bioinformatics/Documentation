# Lustre Storage Usage Guide 

This document outlines the appropriate usage of the three main storage areas on the Lustre filesystem—**Live**, **Ephemeral**, and **Archive**—with a focus on supporting bioinformatics research workflows. Each area is designed for different types of research data and has its own backup schedule and performance characteristics. Using the correct storage tier ensures both data safety and optimal performance of shared resources.

---

## Storage Locations

Each user’s storage directories are organized as follows:

* **Live**: `/home/<username>` (also accessible via `/mnt/lustre/RDS-live/<username>`)
* **Archive**: `/archive/<username>` (also accessible via `/mnt/lustre/RDS-archive/<username>`)
* **Ephemeral**: `/ephemeral/<username>` (also accessible via `/mnt/lustre/RDS-ephemeral/<username>`)

Replace `<username>` with your actual username.

## 1. Live Storage

### Description:

* Frequently backed-up storage area.
* Intended for files that are important and **non-reproducible**, such as pipeline scripts, analysis notebooks, documentation, or configuration files.
* User software environment is kept here (e.g. Python/R libraries, conda installation)

### Backup Policy:

* Backed up **daily**.

### Appropriate Use:

* Snakemake or Nextflow workflows.
* Jupyter notebooks or R scripts used for exploratory data analysis.
* Configuration files.
* Custom scripts for data preprocessing or visualization.

### Avoid:

* Raw sequencing data (e.g., FASTQ files from public repositories).
* Intermediate BAM/VCF files that can be regenerated.
* Large files

###  Tip:

> Use Live to store your analysis logic—anything that defines your pipeline, methods, or parameter choices.

## 2. Archive Storage

### Description:

* Storage area for long-term preservation of research data.
* Designed for large, **hard-to-reproduce** data such as processed results, curated datasets, or outputs from time consuming analyses.

### Backup Policy:

* Backed up **every two weeks**.

### Appropriate Use:

* Finalized analysis output like VCF, GTF, or figures used in publications.
* Results from time-consuming steps like de novo assemblies.
* Annotated datasets, differential expression results, or curated metadata.
* Non-Pirbright Sequencing data that cannot be downloaded readily from a source like SRA, for example data sent by a collaborator. 

### Avoid:

* Files that are still changing, like ongoing result folders.
* Repeated reprocessing outputs that can be generated on demand.

### Tip:

> Archive is your research memory—use it to preserve published results, curated files, and datasets used for reproducibility.

---

## 3. Ephemeral Storage

### Description:

* Temporary storage area with **no backup**.
* High-performance scratch space designed for short-lived and intermediate files.

### Backup Policy:

* **Not backed up**.

### Appropriate Use:

* Alignment outputs (e.g., BAM files) created during a pipeline run.
* Temporary FASTQ files extracted from archives.
* Intermediate files generated by tools.

### Avoid:

* Retaining intermediate files for too long. You will inevitably forget they exist and it will eat up your quota.  

### Bioinformatics Tip:

> Ephemeral is your scratch pad—ideal for temporary files during alignment, quantification, preprocessing etc.

## Summary Table

| Storage Area  | Backup Frequency | Location                                                          | Intended Use                                             | Avoid Storing                               |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Live**      | Daily            | `/home/<username>` or `/mnt/lustre/RDS-live/<username>`           | Workflow scripts, notebooks, config files, job logs      | Raw data, intermediate or regenerable files |
| **Archive**   | Every 2 weeks    | `/archive/<username>` or `/mnt/lustre/RDS-archive/<username>`     | Final VCFs, expression matrices, annotated datasets      | Files still under active development        |
| **Ephemeral** | None             | `/ephemeral/<username>` or `/mnt/lustre/RDS-ephemeral/<username>` | Temporary FASTQ/BAM files, intermediate pipeline outputs | Curated data or final results               |

By following these guidelines, you can protect valuable work, optimize storage performance, and ensure compliance with best practices in data management and reproducibility.

If you have questions, need help categorizing data, or believe you need an exception, please contact your system administrator, data manager or the bioinformatics team.
